## Buckingham green

A child without an eye, made her mother cry, Why ask why, She kept her child clean, on Buckingham Green

## The children saw the eye
as a sign from God, descending from the sky, it was alright to dream, of Buckingham Green

Summon the queen, Spoke the child of eye, it's time to fly, turning fire to steam

On Buckingham Green
