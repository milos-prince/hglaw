Laura started her legal career in Saskatchewan with Churchman & Co. Law Office before joining Hnatyshyn Gough in 2025. She practices primarily in real estate, estate planning, estate administration, and family law, but is keen to explore new areas. 

Outside of the office Laura likes to maximize time spent with friends and family, playing games, camping and cuddling cats.
