      <p>I am a Chartered Arbitrator designated by the ADR Institute of Canada and am an experienced adjudicator in labour, employment, and immigration matters. Many of my decisions have been published across several platforms, including CanLII, Labour Source (WestLaw), and CLAC. These decisions include Canada Labour Code and Immigration and Refugee matters, among others.</p>
      <p>I have been named as an arbitrator in one Collective Agreement in Saskatchewan to date and am currently appointed to several tribunals by both the federal and provincial governments including the Immigration and Refugee Board (Immigration Appeal Division), Environmental Protection Tribunal of Canada, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Saskatchewan Victims Compensation Appeal Committee (Chair), and the adjudication roster for Part III violations of The Saskatchewan Employment Act. I am available for appointments throughout Saskatchewan and am also willing to travel across Canada.</p>
      <p>I am also available to conduct remote or virtual hearings, either by video or teleconference. Presently, due to Covid-19 concerns and restrictions, I have increased my capacity in this regard. Should parties wish to schedule virtual hearings, I am committed to collaboration which will ensure we implement the most suitable process and use the platform most suited to the partiesâ€™ needs.</p>
      <p>I will confirm my hearing and cancellation fee structure upon confirmation of my appointment. My objective is to schedule hearings on a timely basis and exceed expectations for completing decisions on a timely basis.</p>
